# Insider Trading AI System

This project implements an **Insider Trading AI System** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to analyze and predict potential insider trading activities based on financial data and network relationships.

## Features
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Leverages GNNs to model relationships between entities (e.g., traders, companies, transactions).
- **Data Analysis**: Processes financial datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- **Prediction**: Identifies patterns indicative of insider trading activities.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale financial networks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/insider-trading-ai.git
    cd insider-trading-ai
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data <path_to_data>
    ```
3. Run predictions:
